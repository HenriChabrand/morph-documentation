# Card Extension

The Card Extension in our Morph library utilizes a combined model and a service-specific mapping, allowing you to seamlessly build card extensions across multiple CRMs with a single integration logic. This API includes a suite of UI components that you can employ to craft your card extensions, much like using a design system. It boasts the following high-level components:

-   `Card` - This is the core component to be displayed with an array of contents, like a detailed project card, for instance.
-   `Text` - It exhibits key-value detail content within a card, such as showcasing task details.
-   `Status` - It shows content status similar to an information in a card, like displaying the status of a task, for instance.

Each card can deliver interaction functionality through an `Action`. Every action can be linked with an `ActionType`, thereby enabling your user to interact directly with your product via their CRM's card extensions.

## Building

To render a card within your customer's CRM using the Card extension, you need to:

-   Listen to the `card.requested` webhook event from Morph (find more details [here](#))
-   Instantiate `CardBuilder` using the `request.id` 
-   Generate the content for the card(s) using the `CardBuilder` content function, such as `.addText` or `.addStatus` 
-   Once the content is ready, build the card(s) using `CardBuilder.build()`

Generally, you should strive to render something as quickly as possible (\<2s). This ensures a responsive feel to your extension.

Here is an example showcasing a project type card:

```tsx
  const cardBuilder = morph.newCardBuilder(request_id);

  // Get customer data from your backend

  let card = cardBuilder.newCard('HubSpot Extension Project');

  card.newStatus('Status', 'In Progress', 'WARNING');
  card.newText('Project ID', 'HUB-015');
  card.newText('Owner', 'Henri CHABRAND');

  cardBuilder.build();
```
In this case, our `CardBuilder` is initiated from a `request_id`. After the data is retrieved from your backend, we create a `Card` with the content, such as the 'Status', 'Project ID', and 'Owner'.

The card generated is displayed on the different service interfaces:
