# HubSpot Setup

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on integrating the Morph Card Extension into your HubSpot app.

Let's get started!

## Process

<Steps>

### Create a HubSpot App 
![HubSpot Setup – Create App](/assets/docs/hubspot-setup--create-app.png)

Go to the [HubSpot Developers Portal](https://developers.hubspot.com/) and create a new app by following these steps:

1. Click on 'Create an app' and fill in the required details, or open an existing app.
2. In your app's `Auth`, enable the necessary scope for this integration – at a minimum – include `crm.objects.contacts.read` if you want the card to be displayed on contacts' page.

<Callout type='info'>
While the use of Morph does not require this particular authorisation flow, it's important to note that you won't receive any `card.requested` events until your client has installed your HubSpot application. This, in turn, necessitates them going through a full OAuth flow to grant your HubSpot app access to their data.

### Create a CRM Card

Add a new CRM Card to your app by following these steps:

1. Navigate to `Features > CRM Cards`.
2. Click on `Create CRM Card`.
3. Give your card a relevant name. This should represent the object that is going to be displayed (e.g., "Contracts", "Projects").
4. In the `Webhook URL` field, add your webhook receiver in this format:

**`https://api.runmorph.dev/v0/request-hook?service_id=hubspot&hook_redirection=`** `YOUR_WEBHOOK_RECEIVER_URL`

5. Toggle on the entities where you want your cards to be displayed. (at least one)
6. Click `Create`.

Great! Your CRM Card is now set up and linked to Morph. 
</Callout>

### Test the Extension 

Once you have completed the setup process, it is recommended that you test the integration. Here is how you can do it:

1. Open a contact page in HubSpot.
2. A payload similar to the one below should be sent to `YOUR_WEBHOOK_RECEIVER_URL`:

```json
{
  "id": "req-833a-c30f-8765-7f440e1066",
  "created_at": "2023-10-17T09:22:16.040Z",
  "status": "card.requested",
  "context": {
    "service_id": "hubspot",
    "workspace_id": "9950766",
    "entity_type": "contact",
    "entity_id": "123"
  }
}
```

3. Now, you can use the [Card Extension SDK](/card-extension) to build a card response to the card request.

That's it! If you have already set up your webhook receiver to trigger a card build, you should now see your card in HubSpot.
